An introduction to Frontend for beginners
=========================================

Welcome to **An introduction to Backend for beginners**.

This project is intended as a result of an introduction course designed for frontend developers on how to build a simple backend application using spring boot and java.
The application has its own frontend based on spring MVC but exposes some REST services to other applications that might want to integrate.

This application is only a part of an entire solution made to perform a Fullstack course splitted in three modules: backend, [frontend](https://marcomontalbano.github.io/an-introduction-to-frontend-for-beginners), react.
